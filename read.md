Functional Solution
1. How does this solution ensure data immutability?
Everything you create in functional programming is immutable. Objects cna change but the shape shouldn't.

2. The solution is not a pure function?
Given the same input you will get the same output.

3. Is this solution a higher order function?
It is describing a function that takes a function as input. Whether is returns a function or not does not disqualify it for being higher order.

4. Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?
It would not be easier with object oriented programming. You are not trying to represent an object. You are trying to do a simple opertation on an array.

5. Why is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?

Object Oriented Programming:

Abstraction - hiding complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.
Encapsulation - Removing access to part of your code.
Inheritance - It lets an object acquire the properties and methods of another object.
Polymorphism - defines methods in the child class that has the same name as the parent class.

1. Did you use the four pillars?
I definetely used Inheritance. I carried properties from other functions into new functions. Now you do not have to write the same properties mulitple times.
I have also used Polymorphism. The parent classes were passing properties to the child classes.

2. Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different style?
I don't think it would be easier to use another coding solution. There are several objects in this solutions, and object oriented programming allows them to interact.

3. How in particular did Object Oriented Prgramming assist in the solving of this problem?
It allowed me to pass properties to different objects.

Reflection:
1. Is one of these coding paradism "better" than the other?
They are not better than one or the other. You just use them for different types of problems. There is a reason why they both exist.

2. Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigm which seem more appealing?
As of right now I understand the object oriented programming better than the functional programming. However, this does not mean that I will not grow to understand the functional programming. I have noticed that functional programming has less code in many circumstances.

3. Object oriented programming is better for lists. However, functional programming is better for arbitrary data.

4. The functional programming takes more work me to understand. I need to study it more to get better understanding.
